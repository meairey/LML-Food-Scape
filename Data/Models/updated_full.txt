model {

## Other possible approach - matrix of similarities or dissimilarities of differences across sites and use that to construct the random effects
#### Encode expected differences between sites by using correlation matrix that captures differences between sites 
##### Could be something like pairing sites

for(s in 1:species){
  for(i in 1:sites) { ## Each site is now a replicate, and all sites are replicate of the lake... 
    
    # Binomial model
    N[i,s] ~ dpois(lambda[i,s]) ## Now its more of a smooth N (before we were getting with no other site information the abudnance for that site) Now we are implying that site abundances are a little different but now were borrowing relative similarity to other sites.  Still add together the abundance rates for each site. Now the sites know about eachother a little bit...

    # Log-linear model for abundance with habitat-specific intercept 
    log(lambda[i,s]) = beta0[hab[i],s] + beta1[hab[i],s]*wood[i] + ## e (variance parameter from below) ## could have two one for abundance rates and one for detection probabilities ## Add in the offset here (make sure you use the logged distance because I'm using log lambda - needs coefficient of 1)

    # Observation model
    for(j in 1:year) {
        logit(p[i,j,s]) = alpha0[j,s] + alpha1[j,s]*ice_off[j] + ## e (variance parameter from below)
      for(k in 1:replicates) {
        C[i, k, j, s] ~ dbin(p[i,j,s] * site_proportion[i, k], N[i,s])
        
      }
    }
  }

  ## Priors

## Beta and alpha coefficients for each species, no longer for each i
## As well as a random effect that would allow for site to site variation -- awkn the differences across sites within whole lake
#### Probably multivariate normal or something similar
## Lake is the only site and estimate s different versions

  # Prior for beta0, defined for each habitat type - for abundances
  for(k in 1:num_hab) {
    beta0[k,s] ~ dunif(-10, 10) ## Prior for abundance intercept - which gets modified by habitat
    beta1[k,s] ~ dunif(-10,10) ## Prior for abundance slope which gets modified by presence of wood
  }

  # Prior for alpha0 and alpha1 for each replicate/time - for detection
for(k in 1:year){
   alpha0[k,s] ~  dunif(-10, 10) + ## Random effect term which rnorm(mu = 0,variance parameter ##( this is what you're estimating)))
   alpha1[k,s] ~ dunif(-10, 10) ## No longer having an i index for the alpha 
 }
## variance parameter from above needs its own prior (inverse)
